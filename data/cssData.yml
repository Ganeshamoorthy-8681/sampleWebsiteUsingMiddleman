  description:
    CSS3, or Cascading Style Sheets 3, is a technology used in web development
    to design and structure the appearance of web pages. It complements HTML by
    defining how elements should look, including colors, fonts, spacing, and
    layout. CSS3 offers advanced styling features beyond its predecessors,
    allowing for more creative and complex designs. It is employed to style
    text, create layouts, add backgrounds, borders, and animations, as well as
    establish responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
