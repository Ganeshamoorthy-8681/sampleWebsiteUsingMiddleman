  subHeading: Internet
  description:
    The internet's functionality in web development revolves around HTTP
    (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which facilitates communication between
    clients (like web browsers) and servers. This client-server model involves
    requesting resources via URLs, triggering a request-response cycle. the
    client sends an HTTP request, the server processes it, and a response with
    data such as HTML, images, or scripts is returned. HTML structures content,
    CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity. HTTP methods like GET and
    POST dictate request purposes, while cookies and sessions store data for
    state maintenance. This intricate synergy forms the basis of dynamic web
    pages and applications.
