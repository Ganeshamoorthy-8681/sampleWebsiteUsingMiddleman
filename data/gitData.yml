  description: >-
    Git is a version control system that helps developers manage and track
    changes to their code projects. It allows multiple people to collaborate on
    the same codebase simultaneously, keeping track of every modification made
    to the code. With Git, developers can work on different features or bug
    fixes independently in separate branches, and then merge their changes back
    together seamlessly. This prevents conflicts, ensures a history of changes
    is maintained, and enables easy rollback to previous versions if needed.
