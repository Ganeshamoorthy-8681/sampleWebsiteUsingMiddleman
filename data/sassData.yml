  description: >-
    Sass, which stands for "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets," is a
    preprocessor scripting language designed to enhance the way Cascading Style
    Sheets (CSS) are written and managed. It extends the capabilities of regular
    CSS by introducing features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more,
    making it more efficient and organized for styling complex web projects.
