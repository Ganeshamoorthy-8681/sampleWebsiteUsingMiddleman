  description:
    JavaScript (JS) is a programming language primarily used for making websites
    interactive and dynamic. It's an essential component of web development as
    it allows developers to add behaviors, respond to user actions, and update
    content without requiring a page refresh. In the context of the web, JS is
    used to create functionalities like interactive forms, animations, dynamic
    content loading, and real-time updates. When a user interacts with a
    webpage, such as clicking a button or filling out a form, JS can be used to
    execute actions in response. This makes websites feel more engaging and
    responsive.
